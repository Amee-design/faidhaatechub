PROBLEM SECTION
Headline: You remember the birthday. The money doesn't show up.
You want to give your loved ones something special. You promise yourself "this year
will be different." But when the day arrives:  Your salary is already stretched thin
 You're scrambling for last-minute cash
 You settle for something underwhelming
 You feel guilty for months
For others' birthdays: You want to surprise your mom, your partner, your best friend -
but coordinating contributions is exhausting. WhatsApp chaos. Awkward money
requests. People forgetting. Money mixing with your personal funds.
For your own birthday: You drop hints. You hope someone remembers. You watch
another year pass without the celebration you deserve.
Sound familiar?
